Steralis is fairly remote. It's a border Union planet, far enough out they have their own monarchy and as long as they don't make trouble, no one bothers them about it. Things at the province level are fairly autonomous. After the death of the previous king, [[Sten Stera]], there have been some power struggles and no regency has been defined yet. [[Hans Stera]] is the current child-king.
