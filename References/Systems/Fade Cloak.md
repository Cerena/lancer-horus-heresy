>[!quick-action] Activate Fade Cloak
>###### Effect
>When activated, you immediately move out of phase with realspace, becoming intangible. While intangible, you may move through obstructions, but not end your turn within them. You cannot interact with any other object or character or be interacted with in any way (e.g., taking or dealing damage).  
Roll 1d6 at the start of each of your turns: on 3 or less, you return to realspace until the start of your next turn; on 4+, you remain intangible.  
This system remains active for the rest of the scene, or until you deactivate it as a quick action.
